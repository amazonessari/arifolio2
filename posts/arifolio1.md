## Scope

It is designed for my works to be conspicuous because they tell the improvement of my skill. It is important for me who has no much background or degree, and also, to prioritize what a website can convey but document cannot.
Today motion and interactivity are essential to improve usability, so I experimented a lot to incorporate them with learning. It is a slide show to emphasize each project.

## Code

I was struggling with the animation to make this slide show flow from right to left but solved it by laying the elements. Also, SVG images may have bugs during transition unless z-index is written. I learned a lot through the experiments. I am going to continue to take new learnings.
