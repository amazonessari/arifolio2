We held workshop to plan what we convey to whom. In this rebranding we set new persona to target, and drew their customer journey to figure out touch points.

## Code

I designed in Figma, and coded all with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and WordPress under the review by an SEO specialist. Implemented 3 post types News, Blog, and Recruit managed in CMS, and Contact form and Job application form that send to email addresses of the company and applicants.
