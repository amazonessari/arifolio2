summary: "I created this portfolio as my self-introduction in order to connect with global leaders and talents. In this project I do everything from making contents to coding my design. This is also to experiment new design and technologies.
I have created a portfolio before (ARIFOLIO ver1), however, its loose repetition was collapsing the hierarchy. To solve this issue, I clarified the information architecture by following rules strictly."

## Scope
In order to approach global leaders and talents, I avoided to make it only look good, but emphasized the logical process.

## Identity
Black and minimalism are my identity as I only wear the same black outfit everyday. I made this identity from the keyword “Minimalism”.



## Communication
I prioritised usability by making link remarkable, use more images or icons with no much writing. Minimal design makes my works stand out, so tried my best to make it simple.



## Code
I designed in Figma, and coded all with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the static site generating framework HUGO.
