## 1. Research
First I looked through design job recruitments and accepted portfolios of giant tech companies to clarify what is expected of designers.

## 2. Scope
I created content and information architecture to tell their ideal profile and qualifications I meet based on research.
In order to approach global leaders and talents, emphasized the logical process.


## 3. Identity
Black and minimalism are my identity as I only wear the same black outfit everyday. I made this identity from the keyword “Minimalism”.

## 4. Communication
I prioritised usability by making link remarkable, use more images or icons with no much writing. Minimal design makes my works stand out, so tried my best to make it simple.



## 5. Code
I designed in Figma, and coded all with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Next.js.
